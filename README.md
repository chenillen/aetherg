Definition
----------

> In Greek mythology, Aether or Aither (Æthere, Ancient Greek: Αἰθήρ, pronounced [ajtʰɛ̌ːr]) is one of the primordial deities, the first-born elementals. Aether is the personification of the upper air.[1] He embodies the pure upper air that the gods breathe, as opposed to the normal air (ἀήρ, aer) breathed by mortals. Like Tartarus and Erebus, Aether may have had shrines in ancient Greece, but he had no temples and it is unlikely that he had a cult.
